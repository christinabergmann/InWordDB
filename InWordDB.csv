The shy winner quailed at the huge flow of racing enthusiasts. The proud young robin puffed out its vivid scarlet breast and sang. Our uniforms were taken to the dry cleanerâ€™s to be cleaned and pressed. The little bird with the odd crest really drew our attention. We had dressed warmly for our weekend hiking trip in the mountains. Our guide had stressed the importance of bringing plenty of water. At harvest time we worked alongside the farmers that flay the wheat. I think we all felt that the first play we saw was simply riveting. Afterwards we made all sorts of silly creatures with the bright clay. Her hair would splay across her shoulders whenever she brushed it. A white sleigh carried the exuberant actors off of the stage. Some fresh hot fries would taste wonderful with a chocolate milkshake. I found a wonderful prize in my box of caramel popcorn. Sun dries our laundry as quickly as any machine can do it.

The tall willow I like parking under shelters my car from the snow. The warm breeze caressed us as we neared the summit that afternoon. We progressed on schedule until we saw the wild billy goats. Our presence caused some unrest when the herd leader spotted us watching. The new bulb I put in our aquarium hood fluoresced brightly. Now I am saving my nickels and dimes to vacation in Bucharest. They should relay the message to our parents in the countryside. During the winter we go to our private chalet to relax. We were expecting the delay to put us a bit behind schedule. I will mislay the directions if I am not terribly careful. The skilled dentist carefully repaired the milkmanâ€™s gold inlay. A surprise awaited us once we reached the top of the steep hill. We had to be up by sunrise in order to hear the birds sing. Problems arise when I try to read a compass before breakfast. I was overwhelmed by the detailed map I had to memorize.

The folks who donated money for the swings have great wealth. They always bring their cute Welsh Terriers when they visit us. The construction workers must weld together the metal frame. A boy playing in the sand found the remains of a white whelk. The cold wind caused icicles to form along the rooftop edge. Every time we reached the top of the big green hill I would wince. The first team to reach the summit and get the puzzle assembled wins a prize. We dragged a heavy toolbox and winch through the obstacle course. Whoever lost would not cry and whinge much because it was fun. Our inherent right to travel in space is often denied. I envy the astronauts that ride to the big yellow moon. I have heard that it is made of cheese and somewhat rife with holes. If the entire place is made of food it must smell quite ripe. Their space shuttles will go over that rise in the distance. The old mate living on the ship never recycles his cans. The weekend maid told me that she was a bit surprised by this. It would make her wonder if the old man cared about the sea. Next time I get a chance I will have to send mail to her.

A short Welsher fellow raised the money for the new playground. My teacher said he is quite wealthy but usually cheap. The mayorâ€™s attendance at the ground breaking will cause a great welter. My best friend will arrive early because she must welcome him. The last time we visited Windsor it was rather chilly out. Even though the weather was nippy we all avoided whingeing. A bald winsome fellow was jogging in shorts and a t-shirt. Travelling in the fall and winter is easiest for us. We watched the parade from that incredibly grand window. If you look towards the stage you can see the pilot rising now. He was such a great writer even before he learned to fly planes. I guess when a man practices so much his skills must ripen. In a small jet the unfortunate rider has little space. The bright rifle case he had was just a toy made out of plastic. The card mailer wrote to let us know it would rain cats and dogs. So the highly anticipated maiden voyage was postponed. The party we have planned will surely lead to shipyard mania. The crew chief encouraged making this celebration a big deal.

The wealthy tycoon with all the pay pursued his rivals.The young man who often reads the paper sued the lady. The girl with piles of pay perfumed the smelly house.The burning piles of paper fumed through every room. After he was promoted his increased pay permuted into that of his bosses.Although he was conservative his revised paper muted the reply of his colleagues. The abrupt increase in pay pertained to his fine work.The quite sudden rise in paper tainted her good mood. Beacon / Bee-Con: The plastic decorative bee contained the sparkling necklace.The very large and ugly beacon tainted the beautiful skyline. We saw the yellow bee constrained with the weight of its load.The person with the beacon strained to transmit the message. The girl watched the little bee controlling all the rose pollen.The fisherman saw the beacon rolling in the foggy bay. The color of the bee confounded the new beekeeper.The owner of the beacon founded the association. She was surprised to discover the bumble bee confused about flowers.It was amusing to see the overheated beacon fusing to the ice. The vicious bee confronted all the angry crowd.The striped beacon fronted on the rocky shore.

So Annie bought another candle at the stationary store. She came home and put away the old candle. Fran gave that candle to you later. Then she made a place for the new big candle. Your candle is very pretty and smells nice too. Your hamlet lies just over the hill. Far away from here near the sea is an old hamlet. People from the hamlet like to fish. Another hamlet is in the country. People from that hamlet really like to farm. They grow so much that theirs is a very big hamlet. Your kingdom is in a faraway place. The prince used to sail to that kingdom when he came home from school. One day he saw a ghost in this old kingdom. The kingdom started to worry him. So he went to another kingdom. Now in the big kingdom he is happy. The raptor saw you the other day. He's much younger than the old raptor. I think your raptor is very nice. He showed another raptor your pretty picture.
