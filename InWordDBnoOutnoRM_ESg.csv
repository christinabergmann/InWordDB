My friend says that smaller pay perpetuates unhappiness.The girl found the meager paper petulant and annoying. The wealthy tycoon with all the pay pursued his rivals.The young man who often reads the paper sued the lady. The girl with piles of pay perfumed the smelly house.The burning piles of paper fumed through every room. After he was promoted his increased pay permuted into that of his bosses.Although he was conservative his revised paper muted the reply of his colleagues. The abrupt increase in pay pertained to his fine work.The quite sudden rise in paper tainted her good mood. Beacon / Bee-Con: The plastic decorative bee contained the sparkling necklace.The very large and ugly beacon tainted the beautiful skyline. We saw the yellow bee constrained with the weight of its load.The person with the beacon strained to transmit the message. The girl watched the little bee controlling all the rose pollen.The fisherman saw the beacon rolling in the foggy bay. The color of the bee confounded the new beekeeper.The owner of the beacon founded the association. She was surprised to discover the bumble bee confused about flowers.It was amusing to see the overheated beacon fusing to the ice. The vicious bee confronted all the angry crowd.The striped beacon fronted on the rocky shore.
